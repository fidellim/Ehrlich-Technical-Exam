# Ehrlich Technical Exam

## Threaded Landing Page

### Goal

To see the implementation of a web page for a web shop. The front
end implementation needs to be pixel-perfect i.e. it needs to look exactly like the
provided wire frames. You only need to implement the front page of the web shop
and the shopping cart feature. The shopping cart feature needs to use JavaScript i.e.
be interactive and not static. See instruction sections for details. Demonstrate that
you can implement a version of the page which runs in a web browser. This can be a
static page except for the shopping cart feature i.e. adding products to the shopping
cart and viewing the shopping cart.
